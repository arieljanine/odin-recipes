    <h1>Stuffed Winter Squash</h1>
    <img src="../images/squash.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Every fall, the squash calls begin again. They start 
            just here and there. But in October, the pace quickens, 
            and the calls become more panicked. “Help. Need squash 
            recipes.”</p>
        <p>Who can resist those winter squash? The varieties are as 
            plentiful as the stone fruits were a few weeks ago, and 
            it’s hard to remember that you might actually have to eat 
            them when you bring them home. So cheap per pound! And 
            they store so well! And in they go, into your basket, and 
            before you know it . . . help!</p>
        <p>My favorite thing to do with a winter squash is to stuff 
            it. Not only will you use that winter squash taunting you 
            from the counter, you will also use last night’s grain, 
            sad apples that came back in the lunch box one too many 
            times, even old corn bread—they all find their home here. 
            The recipe below is a guideline, but most combinations of 
            grain, green, apple, and meat work perfectly.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 acorn, delicata, dumpling, or carnival squash, cut 
                in half through the stem and seeded</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, plus more for rubbing the 
                squash and oiling the dish</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>6 ounces chorizo or sweet sausage, crumbled or cut into 
                small pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped apple (1 to 2 apples)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups sliced tender greens (spinach, tatsoi, kale, 
                Swiss chard), cut into ribbons</li>
            <li>4 fresh sage leaves, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups cooked millet, rice, or quinoa </li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375° F. Rub the flesh of each squash 
                half with olive oil, and oil an ovenproof dish or baking 
                sheet. Sprinkle the whole baking dish with 1/2 teaspoon 
                of the salt. Lay the squash flesh side down in the dish 
                and bake until it is very tender when pricked with a 
                fork, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the squash from the oven 
                and raise the oven temperature to 425°F.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the remaining olive oil in a large 
                skillet over medium heat. Add the chorizo and fry until 
                browned. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the leeks 
                to the hot oil and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add 
                the apple, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper, and 
                cook for another minute. Add the greens, sage, cooked 
                grains, and reserved chorizo. Cook for another minute, 
                stirring to combine, and remove from heat. Taste, and 
                adjust the salt and pepper if needed.</li>
            <li>Turn the cooked squash over in the baking dish so it is 
                flesh side up. (Be careful, as steam will escape when you 
                turn it.) Scoop the filling into the cavity of each 
                squash half, piling it into a mountain so that it holds 
                as much as possible. Sprinkle with cheese and bake until 
                the cheese melts, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
